## Assumptions
* Data persistence was not required, in-memory storage is being used;
* Transactions with value higher than 10 are automatically denied;
* The credit limit for a client is 100.

## Improvements
* Data persistence could be added to improve reliability;
* The POST call can be updated to use the email as a path parameter, like GET call.

## Support
If you have any question, please send an [email](mailto:juliazottis@hotmail.com).
